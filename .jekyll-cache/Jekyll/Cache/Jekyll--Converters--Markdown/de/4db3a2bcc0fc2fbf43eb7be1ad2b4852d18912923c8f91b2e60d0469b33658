I"Ü<p>My first semester at UF has been an absolute blast and has exceeded my expectations in so many ways. From the friends Iâ€™ve made through the clubs Iâ€™ve joined, to the amazing professors Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with and learn from, to the exciting experience of living independently and making decisions for myself every single day. In this post, Iâ€™m going to talk about some of the experiences that have defined my first semester, and the effect theyâ€™ve all had on my experience here.</p>

<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
<p>Rock climbing was a hobby I got into only a few months before college. Once I arrived at UF, I knew that I wanted to join the Rock Climbing Club as my recreational club. When I attended the first meeting, I was expecting to meet a large group of strangers, but I was very surprised to see many of my older friends from high school being a part of the club. Additionally, the club was very welcoming to new climbers and there was a high percentage of beginners that were in the same position as I was. Over the course of this semester, Iâ€™ve become friends with almost everyone at the club, and have improved enough to work on many of the harder climbing problems that the other members are working on. Iâ€™ve also attended 3 different bouldering competitions since I joined the club, and even placed 3rd in the intermediate division of one of the competitions! Rock climbing has given me a community I feel at home with and a hobby that helps me relax from the stresses of college life. I plan to stay involved with the club over the next semester and following years, and Iâ€™m excited to see whatâ€™s to come.</p>
