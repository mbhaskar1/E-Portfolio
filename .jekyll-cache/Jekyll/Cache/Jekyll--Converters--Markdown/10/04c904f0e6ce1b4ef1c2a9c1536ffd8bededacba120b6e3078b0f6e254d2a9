I"a<p>My first semester at UF has been an absolute blast and has exceeded my expectations in so many ways. From the friends I’ve made through the clubs I’ve joined, to the amazing professors I’ve had the opportunity to work with and learn from, to the exciting experience of living independently and making decisions for myself every single day.</p>
