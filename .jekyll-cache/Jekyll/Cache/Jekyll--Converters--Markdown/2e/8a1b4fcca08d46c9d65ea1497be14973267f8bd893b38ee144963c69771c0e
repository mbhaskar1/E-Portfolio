I"<h3>Monitoring Student Learning and Performance Over Time Using Deep Sequential Models</h3>
<p>
Because of the large influx of computer science students in the past decade, undergraduate computer science education has become characterized by classes in large lecture halls with hundreds of students. With so many students, it is clearly difficult for professors to effectively monitor success in the course and quickly assist students that are at risk of failing. In this work, we propose the application of deep sequential models such as RNN’s and LSTM’s to monitor student success for professors and provide alerts when a student is at risk of failing. We hope to show that these models can function at a high enough accuracy to justify their use in the classroom.
